iOScanX
=======


iOScanX is the highest level part of the eponymous project. Essentially, that takes advantage of the [ScanX framework](https://github.com/alessiomaffeis/ScanX) in order to actualize a practical workflow for scanning iOS applications.

iOScanX provides a clear and intuitive graphical user interface that guides the user through all the steps in the workflow:

1. the first step is the acquisition of a group of applications that are going to be the subject of the scanning. iOScanX is capable of automatically decrypting and importing apps from a jailbroken device, connected via SSH through USB or Wi-Fi;

2. the second one is importing and selecting the analysis modules to be used during the scanning phase. iOScanX will present the user with a list of the metrics provided by each module, along with a concise description;

3. in the third step, iOScanX offers a convenient way of defining and editing evaluation expressions based on the previously displayed modulesâ€™ metrics;

4. the fourth and final step is the review of the results of the analysis. iOScanX comes with an option for exporting the results in the XML plist format.
